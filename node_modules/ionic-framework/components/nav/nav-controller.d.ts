/**
 * _For examples on the basic usage of NavController, check out the
 * [Navigation section](../../../../components/#navigation) of the Component
 * docs._
 *
 * NavController is the base class for navigation controller components like
 * [`Nav`](../Nav/) and [`Tab`](../../Tabs/Tab/). You use navigation controllers
 * to navigate to [pages](#creating_pages) in your app. At a basic level, a
 * navigation controller is an array of pages representing a particular history
 * (of a Tab for example). This array can be manipulated to navigate throughout
 * an app by pushing and popping pages or inserting and removing them at
 * arbitrary locations in history.
 *
 * The current page is the last one in the array, or the top of the stack if we
 * think of it that way.  [Pushing](#push) a new page onto the top of the
 * navigation stack causes the new page to be animated in, while [popping](#pop)
 * the current page will navigate to the previous page in the stack.
 *
 * Unless you are using a directive like [NavPush](../NavPush/), or need a
 * specific NavController, most times you will inject and use a reference to the
 * nearest NavController to manipulate the navigation stack.
 *
 * <h3 id="injecting_nav_controller">Injecting NavController</h3>
 * Injecting NavController will always get you an instance of the nearest
 * NavController, regardless of whether it is a Tab or a Nav.
 *
 * Behind the scenes, when Ionic instantiates a new NavController, it creates an
 * injector with NavController bound to that instance (usually either a Nav or
 * Tab) and adds the injector to its own providers.  For more information on
 * providers and dependency injection, see [Providers and DI]().
 *
 * Instead, you can inject NavController and know that it is the correct
 * navigation controller for most situations (for more advanced situations, see
 * [Menu](../../Menu/Menu/) and [Tab](../../Tab/Tab/)).
 *
 * ```ts
 *  class MyComponent {
 *    constructor(nav: NavController) {
 *      this.nav = nav;
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * <h2 id="creating_pages">Page creation</h2>
 * _For more information on the `@Page` decorator see the [@Page API
 * reference](../../../decorators/Page/)._
 *
 * Pages are created when they are added to the navigation stack.  For methods
 * like [push()](#push), the NavController takes any component class that is
 * decorated with `@Page` as its first argument.  The NavController then
 * compiles that component, adds it to the app and animates it into view.
 *
 * By default, pages are cached and left in the DOM if they are navigated away
 * from but still in the navigation stack (the exiting page on a `push()` for
 * example).  They are destroyed when removed from the navigation stack (on
 * [pop()](#pop) or [setRoot()](#setRoot)).
 *
 *
 * <h2 id="Lifecycle">Lifecycle events</h2>
 * Lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation.  They can be
 * defined in any `@Page` decorated component class.
 *
 * ```ts
 * @Page({
 *   template: 'Hello World'
 * })
 * class HelloWorld {
 *   onPageLoaded() {
 *     console.log("I'm alive!");
 *   }
 *   onPageWillLeave() {
 *     console.log("Looks like I'm about to leave :(");
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 *
 * - `onPageLoaded` - Runs when the page has loaded. This event only happens once per page being created and added to the DOM. If a page leaves but is cached, then this event will not fire again on a subsequent viewing. The `onPageLoaded` event is good place to put your setup code for the page.
 * - `onPageWillEnter` - Runs when the page is about to enter and become the active page.
 * - `onPageDidEnter` - Runs when the page has fully entered and is now the active page. This event will fire, whether it was the first load or a cached page.
 * - `onPageWillLeave` - Runs when the page is about to leave and no longer be the active page.
 * - `onPageDidLeave` - Runs when the page has finished leaving and is no longer the active page.
 * - `onPageWillUnload` - Runs when the page is about to be destroyed and have its elements removed.
 * - `onPageDidUnload` - Runs after the page has been destroyed and its elements have been removed.
